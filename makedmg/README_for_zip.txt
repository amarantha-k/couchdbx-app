Couchbase Server

Couchbase Server is a distributed NoSQL document database for
interactive applications.  Its scale-out architecture runs in the
cloud or on commodity hardware and provides a flexible data model,
consistent high-performance, easy scalability and always-on 24x365
availability.

The server automatically starts after installation and the web-based
console is available on port 8091 (default).
